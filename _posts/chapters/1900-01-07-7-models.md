# Models

We've covered views and controllers, but where's the love for the **M** in the MVC equation? Well, wait no more, because we're going to dive into models. We've written a lot of code for the **VC** parts already, but in practice your models should actually be the "fattest" of the three.

In RubyMotion, there are two big components to models: CoreData and...everything else. CoreData is an ORM of sorts for iOS, sort of like ActiveRecord in Rails-land. It's an incredibly powerful framework but it deserves a chapter onto its own. We're going to be covering "everything else" important in RubyMotion, so let's get to it.

## Model-T

Models are plain-old Ruby objects. We can use the normal Ruby `attr_[accessor/reader/writer]` functions to declare methods which map to instance variables, which is all you really need sometimes. Take a basic `User` object for example:

```ruby
class User
  attr_accessor :id
  attr_accessor :name
  attr_accessor :email
end
```

Now we can manipulate objects like so:

```ruby
@user = User.new
@user.name = "Clay"
@user.email = "clay@mail.com"
```

That's cool, but if we're dealing with some kind of remote API we're probably going to be handed some data from which to parse this `User`. There are a number of ways to do this, but here's my personal favorite:

```ruby
class User
  PROPERTIES = [:id, :name, :email]
  PROPERTIES.each { |prop|
    attr_accessor prop
  }

  def initialize(attributes = {})
    attributes.each { |key, value|
      self.send("#{key}=", value) if PROPERTIES.member? key
    }
  end
end
```

So now we can do a neat trick like this:

```ruby
server_hash = { name: "Clay", email: "my@email.com", id: 1000 }
@user = User.new(server_hash)
@user.name
=> Clay
```

This style also lets us add more properties with ease by simply extending the `PROPERTIES` constant. It's also useful if we ever need to iterate through the attributes of our models, such as when we...I don't know, serialize them. Oh, sorry, was that foreshadowing?

## NSCoding

So now we have a scalable infrastructure for models and we're getting some data from the server. Instead of making API calls every time we want to retrieve that data, we want to check if we have a local copy first (a.k.a. the "cache"). We could write our own custom saving code that writes our objects to a file or something, but there's a better idea.

The `NSUserDefaults` object exists as a persistent key-value store. Typically, we use the instance of `NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults` as our object, like this:

```ruby
@defaults = NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults
@defaults["one"] = 1

# somewhere else, next time we run the app
@defaults["one"]
=> 1
```

Pretty nice right? The values in `NSUserDefaults` are saved as long as your app is installed; if you want to hasten that process, you can call `NSUserDefaults.resetStandardUserDefaults` to purge all entries.

Now, there's one caveat: we can't store any old object in `NSUserDefaults`. We can either store primitives (like strings, integers, and hashes), or we can use raw data/bytes. Since our `User` object isn't a primitive, we have to use the data method. How does that work?

We can put our model through a process called "archiving" using `NSKeyedArchiver`. This class takes an object and creates an instance of `NSData` that `NSUserDefaults` can save. The objects eligible for archiving are known as "`NSCoding` compliant". Basically that means they implement two methods which define how to serialize and unserialize themselves using a standard API. If your models don't implement these methods, they can't be archived.

The two methods to comply with `NSCoding` are `initWithCoder:` (used for loading an object) and `encodeWithCoder:` (used for saving an object). Both of these methods pass an instance of `NSCoder`, which allows us to encode primitive object types for given keys. `NSKeyedArchiver` and its sibling `NSKeyedUnarchiver` use these coders to convert an archived object to and from its saved form.

The two methods should sort of be mirror-images: `encodeWithCoder` should *encode* all of the object's values for some set of keys, and then `initWithCoder` should *set* an object's values via decoding with *those same keys*.

Let's just go through an example and you'll get the idea. Note how the two methods basically do the opposite of each other:

```ruby
class Post
  attr_accessor :message
  attr_accessor :id

  # called when an object is loaded from NSUserDefaults
  # this is an initializer, so should return `self`
  def initWithCoder(decoder)
    self.init
    self.message = decoder.decodeObjectForKey("message")
    self.id = decoder.decodeObjectForKey("id")
    self
  end

  # called when saving an object to NSUserDefaults
  def encodeWithCoder(encoder)
    encoder.encodeObject(self.message, forKey: "message")
    encoder.encodeObject(self.id, forKey: "id")
  end
end
```

So what the heck does this let us do again? It allows you to convert any object into data that can be saved into `NSUserDefaults`. Let me show you:

```ruby
defaults = NSUserDefaults.standardUserDefaults

post = Post.new
post.message = "hello!"
post.id = 1000

post_as_data = NSKeyedArchiver.archivedDataWithRootObject(post)
defaults["saved_post"] = post_as_data

# later on, we want to load this post:

post_as_data = defaults["saved_post"]
post = NSKeyedUnarchiver.unarchiveObjectWithData(post_as_data)
```

These `encodeObject` and `decodeObjectForKey` are pretty cumbersome, so let's take advantage of our API model structure and make life easy:

```ruby
class User
  ...

  def initWithCoder(decoder)
    self.init
    PROPERTIES.each { |prop|
      value = decoder.decodeObjectForKey(prop.to_s)
      self.send((prop.to_s + "=").to_s, value) if value
    }
    self
  end

  # called when saving an object to NSUserDefaults
  def encodeWithCoder(encoder)
    PROPERTIES.each { |prop|
      encoder.encodeObject(self.send(prop), forKey: prop.to_s)
    }
  end
```

Nice, right? One of the biggest pains of Objective-C is that adding new attributes to models is non-trivial. This sort of "magical" Ruby code reduces the friction of making changes to our code.

So now that we have some *really* robust and flexible models, let's put some stuff on the screen for a change.

## Key-Value Observing Example

I think Key-Value Observing (KVO for short) is really freaking cool and will save you a ton of time.

In RubyMotion, objects have the ability to "observe" arbitrary properties of other objects. So let's say I'm observing a user's name; when that user's "#name" property changes values, I automatically get a callback with the new value. There's no custom infrastructure or delegation you have to write, it just works.

The practical example of this is having a view tied to a property of an object, like a `UILabel` which should always represent `@user.name`. When the name changes, the label automatically updates and stays in sync with the model. We're going to implement something like that right now.

Create a new RubyMotion project, like `motion create KeyValueFun`. You also need to make `./app/user.rb`, which is where we'll play with our `User` model.

There's one more thing you need to do: use BubbleWrap.

[BubbleWrap][bw] is a collection of idiomatic Ruby wrappers for the iOS SDK. A lot of Apple's APIs use a system of calling pre-established methods on a callback object. This is preferable on Objective-C but not so much in Ruby, where there have always been anonymous functions to pass around. Thus, many of BubbleWrap's wrappers are just moving such callback method into inline `lambda`s and `block`s. It uses such a wrapper to make Key-Value Observing really simple.

How do we install third-party libraries in RubyMotion? Well, we can either clone the repo and add it to our directory structure, or we can use [RubyGems][gems]. The latter makes third-party code much easier to install and maintain, so I always reccomend checking if a new RubyMotion library can be installed as a gem (and if it isn't, then fork and fix it!)

In your terminal, run `gem install bubble-wrap`. This will install BubbleWrap to your computer like any other gem; however, an error will be thrown if you try to `require "bubble-wrap"` in a non-RubyMotion project.

`require "bubble-wrap"` in the `Rakefile`, like so:

```ruby
$:.unshift("/Library/RubyMotion/lib")
require 'motion/project'
require 'bubble-wrap'

...
```

Now to the real code. In `user.rb`, you can either use the robust, API-friendly `User` class outlined above or use the more concise (but still workable) version:

```ruby
class User
  attr_accessor :id
  attr_accessor :name
  attr_accessor :email
end
```

In `AppDelegate`, we're going to create a label for each of the `User`'s fields: `id`, `name`, and `email`. Then we'll start observing those attributes on our object and update each label accordingly. Sound simple? Well, let's walk through it anyway.

```ruby
class AppDelegate
  include BW::KVO

  attr_accessor :user
  ...
```

In order to use BubbleWrap's nice KVO wrapper (we'll get to that in a second), we need to `include` its methods. You must do this for any object which observes properties. We also added a `#user` attribute, which will make debugging easier. Now, about those views:

```ruby
  def application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions)
    @window = UIWindow.alloc.initWithFrame(UIScreen.mainScreen.applicationFrame)
    @window.makeKeyAndVisible

    @name_label = UILabel.alloc.initWithFrame([[0, 0], [100, 30]])
    @window.addSubview(@name_label)

    @email_label = UILabel.alloc.initWithFrame([[0, @name_label.frame.size.height + 10], @name_label.frame.size])
    @window.addSubview(@email_label)

    @id_label = UILabel.alloc.initWithFrame([[0, @email_label.frame.origin.y + @email_label.frame.size.height + 10], @name_label.frame.size])
    @window.addSubview(@id_label)

    ...
```

We add all of our labels to the `@window`, aligning them vertically. You could make the presentation a lot prettier, but we're trying to be quick here.

Finally, the fun part: `observe`:

```ruby
    ...

    self.user = User.new

    ["name", "id", "email"].each { |prop|
      observe(self.user, prop) do |old_value, new_value|
        instance_variable_get("@#{prop}_label").text = new_value
      end
    }

    true
  end
end
```

The KVO `observe` function is of the form `observe(#<object to be observed>, "the property") do ....`. We use a nice Ruby trick here to reduce duplication with `#each`, but if we flatten this function out for one property it looks like:

```ruby
observe(self.user, "name") do |old_value, new_value|
  instance_variable_get("@name_label").text = new_value
end
```

Cool, right? Now you need to remember that if we re-assign `self.user`, this will stop working because we're specifically only observing whatever `self.user` happens to be at that point in time. So later if we do `self.user = some_other_user`, these observations will stop.

How do we test it? `rake` and head over to the debug console. If we dig around correctly, we should be able to get our `User` object and start playing with it:

```
$ rake
  ...
(main)> delegate = UIApplication.sharedApplication.delegate
=> #<AppDelegate .... >
(main)> user = delegate.user
=> #<NSKVONotifying_User>
(main)> user.email = "test@mail.com"
=> "test@mail.com"
(main)> user.name = "clay"
=> "clay"
(main)> user.id = "9000"
=> "9000"
```

This should produce a result like this:

## Wrapping Up

We've been playing around with the "sexy" parts of iOS for a bit, but at the end of the day a solid model architecture and KVO are just as important to the user experience. What all did we actually learn?

- Models are plain Ruby objects; add properties to them using the `attr_[accessor/reader/writer]` methods
- Use a constant like `PROPERTIES` to define your attributes, it makes loading from a hash in `initialize` really easy.
- `NSUserDefaults` is a persistant store for primitives; use `NSKeyedArchiver` and `NSKeyedUnarchiver` to store your models. This requires you to implement `initWithCoder:` and `encodeWithCoder:` in your class.
- Key-Value Observing lets your objects get notified of changes in another object's properties.
- `include BW::KVO` and use the `observe` function for simple Key-Value Observing.
